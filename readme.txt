= Whatâ€™s going on if i deactivate the Wordpress SEO by Yoast plugin or mqtranslate plugin? =

The plugin depends on these modules or plugins for a correct behaviour because the plugin overwrite some classes to add functionality. 
If you deactive one (or both) plugins, the Wordpress SEO integration will try load the plugins, but this could cause unpredictable behaviour.
